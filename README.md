I'm a random 14 years-old fullstack developer & tech enthusiast.\
I contributed to some projects such as [@Geshii](https://github.com/Geshii)'s website & [@kitsu-app](https://github.com/kitsu-app), a project that I'm currently working on.\
I'm always trying to learn new things, such as how to use other frameworks or languages than those I often use.

### âœ¨ More 'bout me
I was born around Paris and I currently am in highschool (which is pretty cool i guess... no?). I'm most of the time programming or playing some games ([here's my steam page](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sysLambda/)). I may also be cooking or tinkering.\
I love to contribute to open-source projects and make some on my own.\
Oh, and I'm an administrator of [@SynaGames](https://github.com/SynaGames), an organization that propels some various projects. You can take a look at our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SynaGames) *~~or our homepage @ [synagames.com](https://synagames.com)~~ (not ready yet)* to learn more.

#### ðŸ¤” What I like/dislike:
- PHP, C# & Java for their accessibility and their object-oriented concept.
- HTML/CSS because... uh... isn't it useful?
- Javascript for its flexibility, development speed and ez pz production use.
- ElectronJS because it is a great framework using the [NodeJS runtime](https://node.js.org) for running cross-platform applications.
- Python for fast-scripting instead of just using batch or bash.
- boo bootstrap's lame [@jgthms/bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) better>>>

#### ðŸ‘¯ Collaborating
Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborating with whoever has well defined ideas ready to be put in motion together!
