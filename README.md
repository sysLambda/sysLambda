stupid 15-years-old tech enthusiast.\
I'm always trying to learn new things, such as how to use other frameworks or languages than those I often use.

### âœ¨ About me
I was born around Paris and I currently am in highschool. I'm most of the time programming or playing some games ([here's my steam page](https://steamcommunity.com/id/lambdagg/)). I may also be cooking or tinkering.\
I love to contribute to open-source projects and make some on my own.\
I write stupid software as a part of [@jiktim](/jiktim). jiktim. everything jik.

#### ðŸ¤” Technologies and programming language
- C#, Java & TypeScript for their accessibility and object-oriented concept.
- HTML/CSS because... uh... writing websites without is hard.
- JS for its flexibility, development speed and ez pz deployment. TS is still better though.
- ElectronJS because it is a great framework using the [NodeJS runtime](https://node.js.org) for running cross-platform applications.
- Python for fast-scripting instead of just using batch or bash.
- boo bootstrap's lame [@jgthms/bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) better>>>

#### ðŸ‘¯ Collaborating
Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborating with whoever has well defined ideas ready to be put in motion together!
